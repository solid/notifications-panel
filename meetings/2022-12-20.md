## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.


### Update data models
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135

* SC: PR follows the "marathon" work / consensus that updates the data models throughout the spec: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-12-15.md
* SC: Let's check if that's accurate and add more clarity where needed.
* SC: Some questions/todos:
  * Clarifying the concepts/relationships between notification channel type and subscription type, e.g., https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-12-15.md#cases-for-channels-without-subscription-needed
  * Notification Sender aside, we presume there is only one kind of a "client" and that's Subscription Client - whether that's actually going through the subscription steps or not (e.g., in the case with discovering `channel` in the Description Resource).
  * Do we need to mention "Server MUST not change `sendTo`" ? Why would a server do that and wouldn't that be out of spec behaviour?


### Update sequence diagrams
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/133

>ACTION: eP to update diagram if necessary as separate PR

* SC: Just noting here that we can come back to 133 after 135.


### Target terminology

>ACTION: SC: will update LDN subscription type to use `target` instead of `inbox` and `sender` instead of `webid`.

>ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`.


### Release of the spec
