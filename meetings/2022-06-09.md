### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.

#### dokieli
* SC: [dokieli](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli) looks for `solid:storageDescription` (experimenting with this discovery until https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 is resolved) to discover notification channel/subscription information).
* Sc: Implemented a view for "Storage details" - not particularly interesting/useful to the user in the context of notification stuff, but it was to show that the application is aware of what's available at this point.
* SC: Simple screencast at https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355#issuecomment-1140508784 along with other findings in the comment.
* SC: Also implemented subscription request to `WebSocketSubscription2021` and connect to `notify:source`. I didn't yet implement an actual feature to use this - will share that in the future. Need server implementations to move forward in parallel to get anywhere with this. (Also need to have dokieli use Solid OIDC but this is a side issue.)
* SC: Left comments/issues/PRs based on this.


### Discovery of Notification Subscription Metadata
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58

* SC: I'll summarise https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58#issuecomment-1151117524 .


### Next release of Notifications Protocol
* SC: Solid Protocol 0.9.1 will be released with https://github.com/specification/issue/355 resolved and will require (MUST) Notifications Protocol (NP). So, we should resolve https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 (along with some other low hanging stuff and other dependencies) and publish NP-next prior to Solid Protocol 0.9.1.


### Subscription Response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72

* SC: Follows action of https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-19.md#protocol-doesnt-mention-subscription-response re https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/57 .


### Add definitions for notification channel discovery and capabilities
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/70


### Interchangeable use of notification channel type and subscription type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71

* SC: I think we can/should review the modeling around this.
