### Introductions
* Hadrian: I'm born in Europe, moved to US. Lucky to work with projects at scale. Member of Apache foundation. Involved with [IIW](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/). I joined Inrupt looking forward to participate. I was involved with standards as Oasis, also familiar with W3C process.

## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.



### Rename Subscription Client
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/142

>ACTION: eP out of scope communication between different products and interop, taking into account possible Discovery Client extraction.
>ACTION: JM to review 142 and 152.

* JM: After reviewing, initially I had some difficulties after all those clients that existed, but now it doesn't seem that complex. An implementation can group them together if it wants to. As far as the name goes, with my implementer hat I am impartial, whatever it is called is fine with me. I was mainly looking for whether it is too complex to implement. It wasn't.
* eP: JM, are you interested to generalise the Webhook to simplify ??? in my implementation I want to use WebHook and StreamingHTTP so there'd be one code. Generalising some parts.
* JM: Sure. StreamingHTTP spec, is that merged?
* SC: yes
* eP: https://solid.github.io/notifications/streaming-http-channel-2023
* eP: For me it makes sense to separate those classes, streaming-http-channel can support authn, ??? don't need to do subscription can do discovery and connect with NotificationReceiver and that would do the authn.
* SC: Sharing code is great, we do need to have unique code to count is as an implementation. Shared code counts as one implementation.
* eP: No problem to count as one implementation. I'd expect other programming languages to have their own implementations.
* SC: AuthN / AuthZ aside, are there any concerns about extracting Discovery Client as separate product class.
* SC: Any objects to extracting the DiscoveryClient as a separate product or its naming?
* SC: 0 from me. Still think the minimal product can be considered to just do SubscriptionClient.
* eP: +1 to separate Discovery Client and Subscription Client as in sequence diagrams
* RG: I'm in favor of separating them, similar to Pavlik. The Discovery Client can be reused across different channel types.

ACTION: eP to PR an update to sequence diagram.

ACTION: eP to PR text changes.

* SC: This is for 0.3 release.


### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: We also touched the modifying of existing subscriptions
* RG: There might be an old issue
* eP: I think https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/103
* SC: We acknowledge the use cases and look for solution, to a degree we exhausted how it could work. For example how POST approach would work and/or PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
* SC: I have a proposal how we can tackle it
* eP: re approaches, even if we don't define update now, we can define the delete URL, the channel URL can still exist. The delete to that URL would unsubscribe. It would not be necessarily with respect to the notification channel. Server can still use IRI as channel and channel would be deleted.
* RG: Should we have a separate issue to look at approaches?
* eP: There is the subscription response, as well as each notification where possible UC of malicious subscriptions also about providing unsubscribe information in each notification.
* SC: I don't think we should have an issue as a solution. There is no particular new information that a new issue could bring. I'm ok with idea of hiding comments and writing the summarise of the approaches. I think information is there so the jump is to make a PR. I don't want this issue to go longer than necessary.
* eP: Do we want to put unsubscribe and modifying together?
* SC: I think in might be appropriate to look at them together. Essentially about updating the state of the subscription.
* eP: Updating the notification channel. It is more complicated because SubscriptionClient doesn't have control over the notification channel. In subscription request of client or hard requirement. What server needs to offer.
* RG: Lets choose one towards what's mandatory for 0.3. Modify should exist if features exist.
* eP: I have a different angle. For `sendTo` channels, each message should include on how to unsubscribe e.g., the receiver should have a way to unsubscribe.
* SC: Why not update the message data model to indicate the notification channel and that can be used towards unsubscribing or modifying the active subscription?
* eP: may need capability URLs in the message. If the subscriber was the malicious one and the receiver needs to unsubscribe.
* SC: The key is that there is an active channel and we want to change it's state. Why can't be the channel the focus of the whole flow.
* SC: If the sender is aware of the receiver as the controller. Shouldn't it be able to give access to the receiver? The sender is sending the message to the receiver, why can't the subscription service permit the receiver to unsubscribe?
* eP: We can't rely on any information from Subscription Request, since subscription request is made by malicious party. So one would need to discover the receiver identity based on `sendTo` URI.
* SC: In LDN `sendTo` can have a description:  https://solid.github.io/notifications/ldn-channel-2023#notification-subscription-request
* ...: Here we have a `sendTo` with the controller identity. The whole controller part can be left out in the request. The controller could be discovered from `sendTo`. The sender could verify the controller before sending the notification. Check if intended receiver is matching. 
* eP: With that we can require that subscription client was authorized by the receiver to make the subscription. Subscription service can discover receiver from `sendTo` and verify the authorization.
* SC: I don't think Capability URL are fitting the general approach of Solid. They can work but we don't want to have them everywhere.
* eP: I think we go into the next topic here. With explicit `authScheme` we can for now rely on CapabilityURL for websockets and later it could also use some `SolidWebSocketAuthn2025` as an alternative to Capability URL. I wouldn't require updating the `WebSocketChannel2023`
* RG: I think there are 3 separate PRs
  * POST case
  * PUT/PATCH/DELETE case
  * Notification Receiver driven unsubscribing
* SC: I think it's to early to dive into PR, we should discuss it with the whiteboard.
