## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.


### Call for Implementations
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/141

* SC: Please re-share and help keeping the data up to update.


### Add TR/2022/notifications-protocol-20221231
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/491

* SC: Will make sure to merge next week.
* SC: https://github.com/solid/notifications/tree/TR/2022/notifications-protocol-20221231 (just a snapshot for the solid/specification PR and then it'll be read-only)


### Add Solid Notifications vocabulary and JSON-LD context
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/85

* SC: Will make sure to merge next week alongside TR/2022/notifications-protocol-20221231.
* SC: I do want to triple check here with the naming. Note the strings and differences:
  >`http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications`
  >`https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1`
* SC: It'll work just fine (even considering `notifications` and `notification` as different things under `solid/`).
* SC: I just hope there won't be confusion in reuse and that developers will copy/paste.
* SC: Does anyone have concerns we should address about the naming before really going out live with it?


### notifications-ucr
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/issues/76

* SC: Still in my todo. As mentioned, it needs a proper revision.


### Notification Channel Type Registry
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/#notification-channel-type-registry

* SC: Includes registry definition and table.


### TR/notification-subscription-types
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types

* SC: Will add text to indicate it is an old version and refer to https://solidproject.org/TR/#notification-channel-type-registry .


### Include outdated warning in all subscription-types reports
* SC: TODO for editors/authors of:
  * WebSocketSubscription2021
  * StreamingHTTPSubscription2021
  * EventSourceSubscription2021
  * LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021
  * WebHookSubscription2021
  * WebPushSubscription2022
* SC: I can follow-up with updates to the README to draw attention to channel-types (indicate subscription-types is earlier work etc.)


### Ensure EDs of notification-channel type
* SC: Let's please make sure the ED publications of the notification-channel-type reflect notifications-protocol-20221231 for normative and non-normative information (e.g., update examples, authorization info).
* SC: There should be no conflation with the earlier subscription-types approach. Implementers will be referring to these EDs and TRs soon!


### Rename Subscription Resource to Subscription Service?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63

* SC: There is some support to use "subscription service" or "subscription service resource".
* SC: This change doesn't affect conformance, if we agree on change, I suggest that we quickly roll it into Version 0.2.0, TR/notifications-protocol-20221231.
* SC: Any objections or concerns to change to "subscription service"?
*
