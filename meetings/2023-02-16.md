## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.
* SC: Setting next milestones. Thanks eP for raising this!

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Milestones
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/milestones

* SC: Let's mark issues/PRs into appropriate milestones as we process work. 0.3 is next.


### Add ldn-channel-2023 ED
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/147

>ACTION: SC to create issue for `receiver`.

* SC: Done: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/153

>ACTION: SC to merge.

* SC: Done.

>ACTION: SC to follow-up on creating issue for `filter`

* SC: To do.
* SC: I think we said this is next release material in earlier meetings, so I'll mark it as 0.3 when I create the issue.

>ACTION: SC to do editorial update to clarify the diffs better.

* SC: To do.


* SC: For the next topics on reusable terminology, somehow we have duplicate actions based on minutes. Let me just say that in ldn-channel-2023 ( https://solid.github.io/notifications/ldn-channel-2023 ), I simplified to the following since there were no new terms being introduced:
  >This specification uses the terms from the [SOLID-NOTIFICATIONS-PROTOCOL] specification. When Solid Notifications Protocol terminology is used it is linked directly to that specification.
* SC: I suggest we reuse something simple like that across the channel types and then each channel type can of course include additional terms.
* eP: +1 to reusing that

### initial StreamingHTTPChannel2023
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/139

>ACTION: eP to merge and follow up with reusable paragraph on terminology.

* SC: To do.

### Add EventSourceChannel2023 Notification Type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/144

>ACTION: AC [..] follow up with reusable paragraph on terminology.

* SC: To do.


### Rename Subscription Resource to Subscription Service?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63

* SC: Renamed. Updated ED and https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/491 .
* SC: Please use the new terminology in discussions and update text (like comments) where necessary.


### Rename Subscription Client
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/142

>ACTION: eP out of scope communication between different products and interop, taking into account possible Discovery Client extraction.

* SC: To do.
* SC: Ack 0.3 milestone.


### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: Ack 0.3 milestone.
* eP: Want to ask JM to get WebHook to link to this issue inline. So that we don't hold that PR from merging.
* JM: Reasonable to me to get merged in that way.
* JM: What are the next steps?
* eP: Authn is connected here it could be a case.. someone creates a subscription and uses the webhook endpoint but even now if we don't prevent it, it should be possible to unsubscribe where notification URL can have capability URL to unsubscribe. 0.3 or later.
* JM: Those do have subscribed they should have a way to see all of the way subscriptions they currently have. Right now in the reference implementation you have to wait for a request to come in unless you cached it when you made the subscription.
* SC: If new feature, capture in the issue so we can track to develop consensus..
* eP: CSS status on Webhook, in 6.0 branch to be released soon https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/tree/9a640952053d1c46d3aa4b66a370575165d9f73a/src/server/notifications/WebHookSubscription2021 
* SC: In ldn-channel-2023 entertained the possibility with `DELETE` to unsubscribe / remove an active subscription given that a subscription request is given a 201 (URI for the subscription). But It can also go another way: `POST` with payload indicating undoing/deleting/removing/unsubscribing activity.
* RG: Unsubscribing is essential to having a working protocol.  Would prefer it in 0.2 rather than 0.3.
* SC: Returning 201 for the subscription allows identify it, HTTP DELETE would work here. We could also do POST and indicate which subscription we want to terminate.
* eP: RG, why push things to 0.2? I don't think we should add anything to 0.2.
* RG: I said 0.2.1. 
* SC: I don't want to talk about semantic versioning, we unlikely will do 0.2.1 release 0.3 will be next.
* eP: +1 next 0.3 I hope next month
* RG: 0.2 has been hanging for a month an a half, what if similar will happen with next release?
* JM: Generally okay with however long it takes for 0.3 but agree with RG coming to agreement on unsubscribing sooner than later.
* SC: Is the proposal for unsubscribing rolled into webhook channel?
* JM: I understood that Rahul suggested it should be handled in the main protocol.
* SC: If it needs to be different for *receiveFrom* and *sendTo* type of channel we can update protocol for that.


### Too Slow: Please provide Updates-Via shortcut to secure web socket address
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/110

* SC: Proposal to have it for 0.3 milestone.
* SC: I raised about 8 open questions (possibly more) that needs a response from everyone (authors and other contributors) to take into account to move the work forward.
* SC: I don't expect anything in 0.2, it would be great to have some solution for 0.3
* SC: I'm requesting that people quote questions I asked and respond to those specific questions. There are some security considerations that were written. (2nd to last comment I wrote) I don't feel that we are getting straight answers to those questions.
* eP: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/155 can also help with that. Kjetil was suggesting including tokens in response HTTP headers, if we have explicit authn scheme on the channel, e.g., websockets doesn't need to only work with capability URLs.
* SC: Currently everyone is throwing bunch of ideas but we don't answer concrete questions which were asked in this issue. I'm afraid it can be holding merging of 0.2 release.
* RG: Can we have a free form discussion, not today, in one of the following meetings. Rather than doing it in async way we could have focused discussion.
* SC: Would you like to pick it up during next meeting?
* RG: We should plan good 45 min just for that conversation, so we should plan accordingly. I see unsubscribe more urgent.


### initial WebhookChannel2023
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/146

* JM: As writen today it seems to apply it should rely on Solid Protocol. This is okay for subscription - inherently a client-pod relationship. When it comes to subscriber authenticating with the subscriber, the subscriber (Notification Receiver) needs to know the sender is truly who they claim to be so random people can't unsubscribe. All of those things exist in context of user agent inside the authn scenario which is not the scenario. The original proposal for the webhook-subscription-2021 gave sender a public/private key pair, the sender sign it for the subscriber... I will ack that is not LDP-esc, from a high level perspective going with the simpler verification method is better than shoehorn the Solid-OIDC use case. If there is a problem with 2021 technique, it is kind of a strange for LDP, then like to see diff proposal inline with how Solid functions.
* eP: Agree with points you're making. In CG-weekly made comments about this.. in that Solid OIDC is not optimal in this case and need different approaches. I'm willing to put time in with those that want to collaborate on this. It is a bigger topic for Solid.
* eP: in 155, we could use capability URL ... and prefer having schemes / different or unique ones for channels, then continue this topic.
* AC: OpenID Connect is designed for browsers and once you're outside of the browsers it gets complicated. Could start with the browser and generate a refresh token and pass that to server-side application but still starting with the browser. If no browser, OIDC doesn't fit. There are possibilities with OAuth2. Hesitant to inventing something new. That's probably the safest route but it needs to involve a new spec. Can't shoehorn in OIDC because it doesn't do that.
* eP: +1. issue 134 is not necessarily about the identity but related.
* eP: What do you think about different authn scheme for WebHooks? To resolve 155 using capability URL and differing others.
* JM: Will review 155.
* eP: target changed to sendTo. That could be capability URL. In this case NotificationSender makes unauthenticated request with the capability URL - channel is secure by it. 
* JM: Will think about different attack factors.
* SC: Please pay attention to attributes of biblio, I already commented on on of the other PRs, don't merge it. We updated the editors and authors and the title.
* SC: PR 144 and 147 have the correct biblio.


### Identifying NotificationReceiver
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/153

* SC: Ack milestone 0.3.
* SC: Currently we just talk about *sendTo*, in scenarios where we deal with keys, it is useful for the sender to know who the receiver is
* eP: Who is controlling the receiver in a way. Original Webhook channel type had security consideration related to unauthorized creations of subscriptions.
* JM: It was not solved in WebHook either. Everything is open. If lowbar creating a subscription is an authenticated agent. If I create a subscription and send it over to .. DDOS google and create subs - it shouldn't be my right to do that and need to prove. 
* eP: Maybe receiver will be used there also if the receiver is authorising the client.
* SC: See https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/148 security vocab uses controller, the receiver is an agent controlling the sendTo location. They could be on the different origin. When you want to subscribe the subscription client would send the key of the receiver to the subscription service. The subscription server replies with the key of the sender.
* SC: ldn, webhook, webpush can use this?
* eP: ... Those keys need to be discovered before making subscription request. WebPush Subscription request need to know the keys before sending. The subscription service advertises the keys VAPidkeys.
* SC: So two possibilities to obtain the public key, 1) GET subscription service 2) POST subscription service response.
* eP: That can work but WebPush would use 1).
* SC: Jackson do you see any issues with this approach of exchanging keys? 
* JM: believer that what reference implementation is doing. I think this is simple solution but it might require some semantic changes.
* JM: That can work. makes sense as a technique.
* JM: The sender probably shouldn't require an identity provider. The sender .. WebID with a public key inside it. You receive a token signed that is an issuer which is the WebID and get the key in order to verify.

### TR/notification-subscription-types
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types

* SC: Will add text to indicate it is an old version and refer to https://solidproject.org/TR/#notification-channel-type-registry .


### Include outdated warning in all subscription-types reports
* SC: TODO for editors/authors of:
  * WebSocketSubscription2021
  * StreamingHTTPSubscription2021
  * EventSourceSubscription2021
  * LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021
  * WebHookSubscription2021
  * WebPushSubscription2022
* SC: I can follow-up with updates to the README to draw attention to channel-types (indicate subscription-types is earlier work etc.)


### Ensure EDs of notification-channel type
* SC: Let's please make sure the ED publications of the notification-channel-type reflect notifications-protocol-20221231 for normative and non-normative information (e.g., update examples, authorization info).
* SC: There should be no conflation with the earlier subscription-types approach. Implementers will be referring to these EDs and TRs soon!
