## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.
* SC: Setting next milestones

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Milestones
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/milestones

* SC: Let's mark issues/PRs into appropriate milestones as we process work. 0.3 is next.


### Add ldn-channel-2023 ED
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/147

>ACTION: SC to create issue for `receiver`.

* SC: Done: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/153

>ACTION: SC to merge.

>ACTION: SC to follow-up on creating issue for `filter`

* SC: I think we said this is next release material in earlier meetings, so I'll mark it as 0.3 when I create the issue.

>ACTION: SC to do editorial update to clarify the diffs better.

* SC: To do.


* SC: For the next topics on reusable terminology, somehow we have duplicate actions based on minutes. Let me just say that in ldn-channel-2023, I simplified to the following since there were no new terms being introduced:
  >This specification uses the terms from the [SOLID-NOTIFICATIONS-PROTOCOL] specification. When Solid Notifications Protocol terminology is used it is linked directly to that specification.
* SC: I suggest we reuse something simple like that across the channel types and then each channel type can of course include additional terms.

### TR/notification-subscription-types
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types

* SC: Will add text to indicate it is an old version and refer to https://solidproject.org/TR/#notification-channel-type-registry .


### Include outdated warning in all subscription-types reports
* SC: TODO for editors/authors of:
  * WebSocketSubscription2021
  * StreamingHTTPSubscription2021
  * EventSourceSubscription2021
  * LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021
  * WebHookSubscription2021
  * WebPushSubscription2022
* SC: I can follow-up with updates to the README to draw attention to channel-types (indicate subscription-types is earlier work etc.)


### Ensure EDs of notification-channel type
* SC: Let's please make sure the ED publications of the notification-channel-type reflect notifications-protocol-20221231 for normative and non-normative information (e.g., update examples, authorization info).
* SC: There should be no conflation with the earlier subscription-types approach. Implementers will be referring to these EDs and TRs soon!
