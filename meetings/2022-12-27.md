## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.


### Deliverables
* **notifications-protocol (Version 0.x?)** — SC to PR at solid/specification
* **ns/solid/notifications** — AC to update; SC/TBL to merge
* **notifications-ucr** — SC to update and PR in solid/notifications
* **notification-subscription-types** — SC to deprecate, and link to notification-channel-types
* **notification-channel-types** — SC to PR at solid/specification
* **WebSocketSubscription2021 -> WebSocketChannel2023?** — AC to create in solid/notifications. AC (or SC?) to PR at solid/specification
* **StreamingHTTPSubscription2021** — eP to create 2023
* **EventSourceSubscription2021** — AC to create 2023
* **LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021 -> LDNChannel2023?** — SC to PR at solid/notifications and PR at solid/specification
* **WebHookSubscription2021** — ???
* **WebPushSubscription2022** — ???
* **Implementations** — Partial.
* **Test Suite** — Incomplete.


* SC: Should have Test Suite and Implementations for 1.0.
* AC: +1
* RG: UCR and Primer should be complete as well.
* SC: UCR okay. Primer is optional per [charter](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/notifications-panel-charter.md)

* AC: Once for PR for solid/notifications (WebSocket, EventSource), SC can PR for solid/specification.
* SC: Giving consent to update ED without PR.


### Updating or transitioning to channel types
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications#subscription-types

* SC: Transition https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types to /TR/notification-channel-types?
* SC: notification-subscription-types is a living document and it is not versioned or persistence pledged. It could disappear but we have https://solidproject.org/TR/notifications-protocol and https://solidproject.org/TR/websocket-subscription-2021 referring to it.
* AC: +1 simplest. Keep current and publish notification-channel-types.


### Update data models
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135

>ACTION: eP: create issue on considering request as requirement or preference, and whether server can overwrite desired channel properties or has to reject if can't satisfy

>ACTION: eP to create issue discussing need for `channel` to be defined in the vocab or just in JSON-LD context.

* SC: Can we merge in this call after resolving https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135#issuecomment-1365984108 ?
* SC: Group considered the options and decided to go with `startAt` and `endAt`.
* SC: Merging.


### Add Solid Notification JSON-LD context
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/62

* SC: Pass through once above issues/PRs are resolved.



### Update sequence diagrams
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/133

>ACTION: eP to update diagram if necessary as separate PR

>* SC: Just noting here that we can come back to [133](https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/133) after [135](https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135).


### The `state` feature

>ACTION: Create issue for `state`. Mentioned it is currently designed for single resource and doesn't handle multiple topics.

* SC: Would anyone like to record that issue?
* AC: There are ways to do multiple resources, but possibly messy. Inclined to say it is a feature at risk.
* SC: Should we do that for the current spec?
* AC: It is an optional feature and doesn't have implementations, so can't say it is officially at disk. Given its target was for the pre-1.0 spec, it is okay to be removed for 1.0.
* SC: +1 to leave as is. Revisit.
* RG: If a client decides to watch multiple resources, it needs to know that it needs the most up-to-date state for all those resources. What other thoughts/ideas do you have for implementing, and how would that reflect the spec?
* AC: I'd probably grab ETag and hash into composite or something where there is a composite structure, but I don't like that structure and not sure if a state variable is the best way to represent how we coordinate multiple resources. We may end up with something with a different model.
* RG: We could just have an array of resources with a tuple for ETag.
* AC: That may be the better model.
* SC: Lets go through that in the issue.
* AC: *Leaves meeting*


### Rename Subscription Resource to Subscription Service?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63



### Target terminology

>ACTION: SC: will update LDN subscription type to use `target` instead of `inbox` and `sender` instead of `webid`.

* SC : Using `sendTo` instead of `target` but yes, updated towards LDNChannel2023 spec.

>ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`.


### Reconsider notify:source
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/74

* SC: Should be resolved from [PR 135](https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135), but vocab/JSON-LD context needs an update.

### Spec queries found while testing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/98

* SC: Commented for AC to see WebSocket parts.

### A consistent naming scheme for Channel Types
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/34

* SC: Commented.

### How can we version the notifications mechanism?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/10

* SC: 0.2 or 0.9 perhaps for the next release. will deal with it at the time PR depending on mood and the moon.
