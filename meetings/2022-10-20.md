## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.
* RG: http://gitlab.com/syntropize/syntropize
* RG: http://syntropize.com/
* RG: Syntrpize "an operating environment for intelligence augmentation"
* RG: Data is coming from a large number of files.
* RG: Same data with different views. Cards explaining the application.
* RG: I need to have notifications for all of those things.
* SC: Check out the work on https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos and connect with the team there about your work. There is some overlap. I think you can exchange notes. Join https://gitter.im/solid/solidos and there is a weekly (Wednesday) meeting where you could perhaps demo this and they'll tell you what they have that's similar.



### Define Notification Content
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/60

* SC: Right now it highlights what may be overspecifying, constraining, exposing information.
* SC: We should consider a simpler / minimal model for conformance.

ACTION: SC to review again.



### Notification Profiles
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/101

>Introduce the notion of Notification Profile as an extension of the core Notification Data Model.
>Specific Notification Profiles can then be independently published.

* SC: Not necessary for the next release of the notifications protocol but if done in parallel we could maybe squeeze it in.
* RG: Agree.
* SC: Dependency on https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/60
* RG: Why is it a dependency?
* SC: I thought that once we know the core model we can know how we are building / extending on top of that. So, for example, if the core notification has a start/endTime, then we can expect that to be available across all notification profiles (which are only extensions), e.g., notifications that are specific to express a delta/change about a resource, would also automatically include start/endTime. See also https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/111 .
* RG: What's core? To compare our interpretations.
* SC: Core as in minimum required information for a notification.
* RG: So, if you have the core specification defined, this portion can be defined orthogonally.
* SC: Right. The Notification Protocol only needs to explain how that extension is done, just like it says for features and subscription types.



### Update Notification UCR
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/issues/76

* SC: I need to fill in missing information in the UCR but there are some corrections that need to be made.
* SC: The way some of the UCs read is overly specific about technologies. There should be no mention of specific solutions.
* SC: e.g., https://solid.github.io/notifications-panel/notifications-ucr#use-case-time-bound-subscriptions , #use-case-lost-updates , #use-case-capability-discovery would at least need updating.

ACTION: SC to follow up.
