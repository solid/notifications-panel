## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.

### Subscription Request Response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72

* SC: Followed up but (I) still need to wrap up: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72#discussion_r913913397 . My author-level preference is to keep request/response to JSON-LD.
* CB: I do not oppose specifying JSON-LD as the minimum necessary to support but I would like to allow support for other content-types, e.g., `text/turtle`.
* SC: Client can always include `text/turtle` in `Accept` header.
* SC: Will update based on your last comment.


### Interchangeable use of notification channel type and subscription type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71

>* SC: I think we can/should review the modeling around this.
>* SC: I think this is a bug. Lets come back to it with responses...

* SC: Lets come back.
* CB: I wouldn't oppose to the change.


### Solid Notifications Protocol: Review notes
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/76

* SC: Talked with Tim about it (some specifics) but I didn't process the notes/review yet.
* CB: Did not yet find time to look at it in detail. Sorry.


### Discovery of Notification Subscription Metadata
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58

* SC: We need to resolve some outstanding questions.
* CB: I added a comment to the issue https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58#issuecomment-1177700764 re: Should a resource be able to advertise a non-storage-bound notification channel?
* CB: I would be in favour of specifying storage description-based discovery as the default but also allowing for resource-specific discovery of non-storage-bound notification channels.


### Next release of Notifications Protocol
* SC: Solid Protocol 0.9.1 will be released with https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 resolved and will require (`MUST`) Notifications Protocol (NP). So, we should resolve https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 (along with some other low hanging fruit and other dependencies), and publish NP-next prior to Solid Protocol 0.9.1.



### Subscription resource as a container
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/36

* CB: Request for comment :)
* SC: OKie.
