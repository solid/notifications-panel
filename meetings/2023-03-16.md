### Possible optimization while using StreamingHTTP channel
URL: https://matrix.to/#/!WdNSKNKuHrHkWppqfn:gitter.im/$b8VNQ3m096NLrWSjvDdRGm5M1nvMy5Eyq_v3xN-wILg

* RG: The reason we are sending capability URLs is to change protocols.
* RG: Assume that in an alternate universe, we were designing a notifications protocol with only StreamingHTTP.
* RG: We have broadly identified the following requirements to start notifications:
  1. The Receiver needs to communicate that she is Authenticated Alice and not Random Bob.
  2. The Receiver needs to provide a list of routes (topic resources).
  3. The Receiver needs to communicate the features for the notification channel.
* RG: We have identified the following requirements to manage notifications:
  1. The Receiver needs to update routes and features.
  2. The Receiver needs to unsubscribe.
* RG: The argument over the unsubscribe model has got me thinking. Right now, the client subscribes with a Subscription Service using `POST`. What if, for StreamingHTTP, instead of sending back a capability URL, the Server starts streaming a response? A `POST` to the Streaming Service (interim name for the combined endpoint in the new model) can communicate all the information, and the response can begin with the notification channel model (whether in the body or header can be argued) followed by the notifications.
* RG: One of the models proposed in the modify/unsubscribe model is to use `POST` exclusively to modify and unsubscribe. We can do the same with the Streaming Service, with one of the following outcomes: 
  1. Changes are acknowledged in the new response; Original stream continues.
  2. Stream is moved over to the new response.
* RG: We can use PATCH/DELETE as well if the first message/header to the initial POST provides a management URI.
* RG: I think this will work just as well and allow one round-trip subscription (Assuming we have minimal discovery information in header, that's a separate issue though) resolving #110.
* eP: It could be doable, but as a feature. I don't think it could be used as a general flow. We cannot assume that the subscription server can serve notifications.
* RG: Agreed.
* SC: How would this be different for other types?
* RG: For websockets and eventsource, you switch protocols
* SC: Isn't events source in the same category?
* eP: I don't think it would be doable; the browser API doesn't let you set headers.
* SC: Is the difference between Websocket and EventSource mostly the scheme? 
* RG: Websockets is bi-directional
* RG: The objection in #110 was that there is an extra round-trip to get to notifications. This approach eliminates one round-trip.
* eP: If there are pre-established channels, you get the same number of connections.
* eP: If we agree that this is a feature, it's ok to have additional features.
* eP: Propose to have a mini-spec for features
* SC: Asks to clarify what exactly we mean by feature.
* eP: https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#notification-features
* RG: It is a notification feature. The Discovery will advertise the option for immediate streaming available on a channel, and the Subscription client may request the immediate streaming on the subscription request.
* SC: Let's split the discussion on features that are made available by some channel types to activate notifications from the `startAt` time that's requested in a subscription request. There is overlap.
* SC: We're talking about channel or the subscription description signalling that notifications can be activated immediately as part of a new feature. That's similar to a subscription request including `startAt`.
* RG: When a client makes a request to a subscription server, providing a `startAt`, the server can still respond with ??? part of the subscription response. 
* eP: We can iron out the details in the PR. We shouldn't jump today into details. We should just decide what the next step is.
* SC: Can we create an issue?
* RG: I think I have a concrete idea for implementation. Prefer a PR.
* eP: Why not create a mini-spec?
* RG: Maybe change the protocol a little bit to specify that features could be defined externally.
* HZ: Asks for clarifications related to compliance and the negotiation of the set of (optional) features supported by both client and server.
* eP and SC: clarify and point to the language in the spec.
* eP: We have Capability URLs and Capability-based authorization systems. I think using it as synonym to features would be confusing.

ACTION: RG to create an issue.

### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: Hoped we could start this topic with whiteboarding. Not enough time left.

ACTION: SC to summarize the key behaviours for some of these options.

* SC: Can we pick this up first thing in next meeting?
* eP: Outlined two aspects in the issue. We need to consider both cases.
* SC: Likes the idea. Need to be clear on the use cases.
* SC: Question: would it make sense if we looked at the case where the sender should try to verify if receivers can accept prior to getting notifications.
* eP: We discussed approach where `sendTo` endpoint advertises the identity of the receiver. In that case, the Subscription Server can discover it and verify whether the subscription client is authorized by the receiver.

ACTION: eP to create a issue to discuss advising subscription services of authorization changes on topics.
