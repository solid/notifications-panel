## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.


### WebHooks

>ACTION: eP to update draft PR to Webhooks as 0.2 https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/113
>ACTION: eP to propose webhook-subscription-2021 version 0.2 as a TR (based off GH Pages of webhook-subscription-2021 ED).

* SC: Come back later to last two ACTIONs.
* eP: there is no urgency for this; we can come back to this item later, after the protocol release

### Target terminology

* SC: In the past, we aligned on `target` terminology
* eP: WebHooks already uses `target`; LDN would need to change from `inbox` to `target`.

ACTION: SC: will update LDN subscription type to use `target` instead of `inbox` and `sender` instead of `webid`.

ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`


### Update conformance model
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/120

>ACTION: eP to update diagram if necessary as separate PR

* SC: I have one commit to follow and that's to change `text/requirementSubject` to match the classes of products.
* SC: certain terms will be changed to match the new conformance terminology
* eP: has looked at the [https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#overview](diagrams) to align the terminology with the new conformance model
    * `Subscriber` changes to `Subscription Client`
    * `Subscription Resource` changes to `Subscription Server`
    * `Discovery Resource` changes to `Resource Server`
    * `Notification Target` changes to `Notification Receiver`
    * `Notification Source` changes to `Notification Sender`
* SC: the resource server and subscription server could be different entities, so we use different terms

ACTION: eP will make PR as discussed


### Interchangeable use of notification channel type and subscription type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71

* SC: I'm drafting a PR for `subscriptionType`
* SC: There is currently a property for `notificationChannel`, but the relationship between a subscription type is a bit unclear
* SC: The change will use `subscriptionType` as a property that defines the type of subscription rather than using `rdf:type`
* SC: Are there channels that would not have a subscription type?
* RG: Are you trying to include push notifications here, too?
* eP: related to use cases, for instance, with public/static types, I don't see a use case for channels that would not involve a specific type. We always need a `topic` which gets indicated during subscription step.
* TT: "Zero or one" is a better formulation than "None or one". "Zero or more...", "Zero or one...", "One..." are preferable to "[Zero|None], one, or many..." which is awkward at best. "No" could also replace "None".
* SC: would others prefer "zero"?
    * AC: +1
    * eP: +1
* RG: I still don't understand case of zero subscription type.
* SC: If subscribing server can't handle that, it will just reject it. 
* eP: Since we don't have use case from subscribing client implementing perspective, I see clear one as better requirement.
* SC: Shall we include the `subscriptionType` property?
    * eP: +1
    * AC: +1
* RG: `subscription` resource is unclear.
* SC: I would leave this as `subscription` or `subscriptionResource`, as that aligns with the current terminology.
* eP: We should try to resolve this next week.

ACTION: SC to PR.


### Update subscription data model
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/130

* SC: Last week we were brainstorming how to update definitions of subscription request and subscription response. This PR reflects that.
* ...: If channel offers features, you could include them in the request, but don't need to.
* ...: response would have source or sender for target based subscriptions.
* ...: I changed terminology from statements to model
* ...: There is a breaking change with `expiration` features changing to `endTime`
* eP: related to the case where there is a single subscription with multiple topics, should the client assume that the response is the canonical list of topics that are included in a subscription?
* SC: in the case where a client would like to subscribe to multiple resources, I can see how subscribing to different topics would be valuable.
* AC: I think the basic question is weather the request from the client is indication of requirements or preferences. If client says they want two specific topics. If server treats is as preference it can just respond with one, if the other is not authorized. If it treats it as requirement it would fail the whole request. In the text we have in other places it seems that we consider request as indication of preferences not requirements.
* SC: Can you elaborate please on the preferences.
* AC: If we look at features. Let's say client wants Turtle, not JSON-LD. If server doesn't support Turtle, should request fail or can server just create subscription of different media type? Is it more to consider it as accept header? I think it's better if server can't satisfy the request, we should not create subscription. Which raises question, what does response look like?
* RG: We might want to deal with features and topics as separate cases. I don't think if you can accept a subset of topics, the server should not fail the request. However, for consistency with http, say, for the wrong format, server should fail the request. 
* eP: This is an example of where an inline issue could be valuable for the specification. This way implementers can have an indication that this aspect of the specification may change.
* SC: I think failing response is covered by HTTP 422 response code. I can update that requirement without PR.
* SC: `s/if a subscription request does not satisfy the payload constraints/unable to process the contained instructions`

ACTION: SC to change wording for `#server-subscription-request-payload-invalid`

* RG: ??? regarding error response payload
* AC: I think this is a very big conversation. This is a Solid Protocol-level issue; it would be good to find a solution which is consistent across Solid.
* SC: Defer to https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/28


### Release of the spec
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-11-10.md#release-of-the-spec

>ACTION: SC to review https://hackmd.io/3sLhQvmKTVKQKoXeXLSTpA

>The resource from which we obtain information about how we can subscribe to notification and what "types" of notifications are available.

* SC: This is useful clarification â€” whether specific types are listed or not, e.g., see https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/191 for a list of stuff. Not that those are actually advertised, but they are observed on some level in a pod.
* SC: I suggest that the Solid Notifications Protocol (SNP) leave this undefined to allow healthy variance. The key part here is that a resource server will decide whether it offers any notification service for a given resource. There is also no need to set this limitation on the SNP spec.
* SC: Covered by notification-channel-resource

>+ The resource/container on which we make a POST request to request a for new subscription
>+ The resource (if we decide that a resource is created?) which is created upon a request for a new subscription. The requester can also subsequently GET on this resource and obtain the subscription specific information (see below).

* SC: Is this https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/36 ? And touched on in https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/111#issuecomment-1257700934 ?

>In one of the meetings the possibility of having resource specific discovery resource was raised. Presumably, if the requester uses that resource specific information then subscription would then be specific to that resource. How do you support connections to multiple resources then? (Issue #22: note cxres issues)

* SC: Obviously can't. Request can be sent but I presume the subscription server would only recognise the resource that's valid or maybe just reject the request altogether.

...


>I am against mandating Activity Streams as an exclusive format. I would rather have language that says "at a minimum" AS2 but provide flexibility to serve other formats (this is important to me for creating a unified abstraction that can span storages other than solid pods in a performant way).

* SC: This is already possible. AS is just minimum/core. Additional context/vocabs can be used.
