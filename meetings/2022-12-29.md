### Rename Subscription Resource to Subscription Service?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63



### Target terminology

>ACTION: SC: will update LDN subscription type to use `target` instead of `inbox` and `sender` instead of `webid`.

* SC: Using `sendTo` instead of `target` but yes, updated towards LDNChannel2023 spec.
* SC: WebSocketChannel2023 will use `receiveFrom` instead of `source` ( https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/138 ).

>ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`.


### Reconsider notify:source
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/74

* SC: Should be resolved from [PR 135](https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/135), but vocab/JSON-LD context needs an update.
