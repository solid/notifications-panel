URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63



### Target terminology

* SC: Using `sendTo` instead of `target` but yes, updated towards LDNChannel2023 spec.
* SC: WebSocketChannel2023 will use `receiveFrom` instead of `source` ( https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/138 ).

>ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`.


### Reconsider notify:source
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/74
