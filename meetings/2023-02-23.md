## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Add ldn-channel-2023 ED
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/147

>ACTION: SC to follow-up on creating issue for `filter`

>* SC: To do.
>* SC: I think we said this is next release material in earlier meetings, so I'll mark it as 0.3 when I create the issue.

* SC: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/159

>ACTION: SC to do editorial update to clarify the diffs better.

* SC: To do.



### Rename Subscription Client
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/142

>ACTION: eP out of scope communication between different products and interop, taking into account possible Discovery Client extraction.

* SC: To do.
* SC: Ack 0.3 milestone.
* eP: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/152 for revisiting expected interactions.
* SC: So, add `DiscoveryClient` to `#classes-of-products`, remove (or change) `SubscriptionClient`→`ResourceServer` and add (or change to) `DiscoveryClient`→`ResourceServer` to `https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#interoperability` 
* SC: `DiscoveryClient` as a product doesn't quite jump out. (I still think we don't need to separate this as a separate product from `SubscriptionClient`.)
* SC: I do like the idea that `DiscoveryClient` can be extended to have a `SubscriptionClient` (or the other way, `SC` would build `DC` as well.)
* eP: Discovery Client also discovers the Subscription Service (run by Subscription Server), not only Notification Channel.

ACTION: JM to review 142 and 152.


### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: ...
* eP: Need information on how to unsubscribe. If someone created a subscription, and then whoever the receiver considers it unwanted, they should be able to unsubscribe. Each notification could do that.
* SC: So, `NotificationReceiver` and `SubscriptionClient` are two products (and use cases) that could potentially unsubscribe?
* eP: Could look at it two ways. `NR` can unsubscribe or `NR` can also out of scope give info to `SC` that can follow up with the `SC`. I like `SC` being responsible with that. `NR` would not have to interact.
* SC: Seems whatever conforms to `SC` would do it in the end.
* eP: Comes down to authn/z at some point. `SC` would unsubscribe especially it initially authenticates.
* SC: Notification may only need to know the notification-channel that the notification is part of. `SC` can use that info.
* eP: 
* SC: Let's look at two cases, `sendTo` and `receiveFrom`. For `receiveFrom`, it seems that you have application doing both `NR` and `SC`.
* eP: In `receiveFrom` the `NR` can just disconnect, so it's mostly about `sendTo` where `NR` might need information to unsubscribe.
* SC: For any notification channel that is active, server needs to have consistent way to unsubscribe. 
* eP: If you just disconnect like on mobile device, a loop (like in the sequence diagram), you could reconnect. With capability based channel, when done, I can subscribe; no-one can then reconnect to existing channel, because it is no longer active.


### Make AuthN/AuthZ of each channel explicit
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/155

* JM: Are there UCs with one authentication technique like Webhooks where the question is up in the air, what the authentication technique is?
* eP: e.g., CSS uses Solid-OIDC taking advantage that it has built-in IdP.
* JM: The current implementation on CSS. I don't think that should exist at all. The solution to build a discovery system requires clients to adapt, but to change auth in Webhook for all these deployments as we referenced.
* eP: Why would you want to forbid the WebHook channel to use ??? or ???. If in the WebHook spec, you say that, the Solid Protocol would define, then you don't allow something as simple as capability URL. For most clients, using capability URLs, you don't do authentication, but keep the link secure. It'd be easier for clients to implement capability URL
* JM: I don't think WebHook should just defer to Solid Protocol authentication scheme. `WebHookChannel2023` should define some kind of authentication protocol that it must use. That should work with all deployments. The other point is a clarification on capability URLs. I don't see how it solves the main issue. It is just a URL for the sender that embeds the resource server that was the source.
* eP: `SC` uses capability URL to create a notification channel. The `NotificationSender` does not need to authenticate.
* JM: Possible technique. Security by obscurity isn't great.
* eP: Possibility of collision is low. As I understand UUID, unless the seed is known, it shouldn't be randomly hit.
* SC: Intercept instead though.
* JM: Intercept at compromised browser.
