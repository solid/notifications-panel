## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Subscribing to authorized resources

* HZ: Is it possible to subscribe to authorized resources?
* SC: https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#security-privacy-review-personal-data
* HZ: Related to grants.
* eP: I don't understand the UC re if unable to read the resource.
* HZ: The question is related to governance and community services that could be made aware of existence of data from many members (Solid Pods).
* eP: Then how can you tell which data is available?
* HZ: It's not like notifications are made available to anybody, but it would be a different type of grant for trusted services.
* eP: ...
* RG: It can also be the case a when an offer becomes available.
* SC: Subscription request. When access is granted, notifications can be sent.


### Milestones
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/milestone/1


### Add resource-server-description-resource-response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/169

* SC: One approval (Pavlik).

ACTION: 

* RG: Have to go.


### JSON-LD Context URI
* SC: Currently it is `https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1` . Okay to go? Version 0.2.0 of spec requires that. There was discussion in the solid specification chat whether that's intended... given `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications`.
* eP: Up to W3C so doesn't matter for the client. The spec just mandates it and W3C hosts it.
* SC: Solid OIDC uses `https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/oidc-context.jsonld` and vocab being `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/oidc`.
* eP: Doesn't matter really. Opaque URL. Copied/pasted.
* eP: There may be a possibility of Solid-OIDC to drop the context. The OIDC related stuff may be OIDC-Federation. Client-metadata. OIDC-based technologies. They use well-known.

ACTION: SC to ping W3C to make sure to finalise/publish /v1.


### Include JSON-LD context verbatim in an appendix
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/170

* eP: Just convenience for implementers. Sometimes it is not published. For those times it is for some context. Best practise for implementations to us a local copy and not fetch at run-time. There may be some delay before it gets updated at W3C.
* SC: That may be confusing - having authoritative source (at ns/) and copy in spec which may not be the same. Better to have a single source of truth at ns/. If need to clarify / close the gap e.g., implementers encouraged to have a local cache, as a note?
* eP: I suggested implementers not to rely on the context. Our use of JSON-LD may be a bit sloppy for notifications? It needs to be worked out. For that we should coordinate with the JSON-LD CG. Not notifications specific. Usually JSON-LD will use compacting, and consumer using JSON parser and probably not even parse as RDF. How CSS currently serialises is spec conformant. Still need to parse it as JSON-LD. In the end we recommend JSON-LD but don't benefit. Could do Turtle. We may not be getting what we want.
* SC: But it is just RDF.
* eP: If don't care about compacting then no specific reason for context.


### SHACL shapes for data models
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/168


### Proposed optimization when using StreamingHTTP channel
https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/164



### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: Hoped we could start this topic with whiteboarding. Not enough time left.

>ACTION: SC to summarize the key behaviours for some of these options.

* SC: Todo still.

>ACTION: eP to create a issue to discuss advising subscription services of authorization changes on topics.
