### Update notification-channel-conformance
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/131

* SC: Need to resolve notification resource data model, which will probably impact the subscription request/response data model.
* SC: I want to acknowledge Pavlik's point about describing the Subscription Resource instead of Notification Channel Resource. I wrote some consideration in the comment on the PR.
* ...: Pavlik is saying that since we already have the subscription resources, that is what we are describing. You can make Subscription Request targeting that Subscription Resource. Currently notification channel has Subscription Resource referenced as `subscription`. My worry is that that would be describing something somewhere, that subject.
* eP: Subscription client wants to make a subscription request. currently we call that subscription resource. We can describe that and not the notification channel. The feature is also with the subscription resource. What can be included in the subscription request. Minimise construct/terminology.
* SC: +1
* RG: Two or three things. One I really want to process it written in the comments. Second, you are subscribing to notification service not subscription service. Subscription can be anything, we are subscribing to notifications. I don't see why using word notification is a problem.
* SC: I don't know how we got into channel. We are talking about some service, I don't want to get stuck on the specific term, subscription or notification. I think there is some kind of subscription service available, it is of this type and it has some feature.
* RG: I see subscription service as notification service. By notifications channel i understand that we can receive notifications by one of those channels.
* SC: The proposal I made may bring it closer to what Rahul wants. We can call property `notificationService`
* eP: if we use type, it should be an instance of that class. then we can decide what those instances be.

* SC: Let's discuss over code here:


#### Description Resource

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
  "service": [ //XXX: formerly notificationChannel
    {
      "id": "https://websocket.example/subscription",
      "type": "SubscriptionResource", //XXX: formerly WebSocketSubscription2021
      "channelType": "WebSocketNotifications2023",
      "feature": ["state", "rate", "endTime"]
    }
  ],
  "channel": [
    {
      "id": "#WebSocketsNotfications2023", // or omit id.
      "type": ["WebSocketsNotfications2023", "NotificationChannel"],
      "topic": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
      "receiveFrom": "http://websocket.example/notify/guinan/profile", // or receiveFrom
      "rate": "P1M"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### cases for channels without subscription needed

1. public topics, any channel type, no authn required
2. streaming http channel, authn on the source

#### Subscription Resource

* eP: Other name options:
  * Subscription Server (and correspondingly Subscription Service)
  * Subscription Endpoint

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://websocket.example/subscription",
  "type": "SubscriptionResource",
  "channelType": "WebSocketNotifications2023",
  "feature": ["state", "rate", "endTime"]
}
```

#### Subscription Request

Request for notifications is made to the Subscription Resource.

```
POST https://websocket.example/subscription
```

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
  ],
  "id": "",
  "type": ["WebSocketNotifications2023", "NotificationsChannel"],
  "topic": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
  "receiveFrom": "http://websocket.example/some-capability-url",
  "state": "",
  "rate": "P1M",
  "startTime": "2023...",
  "endTime": "2024..."
}
```

* `receiveFrom`/`sendTo` formerly `source`/`target`

  ```http
  POST https://websocket.example/subscription
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
    ],
    "type": ["WebHookNotifications2023", "NotificationsChannel"],
    "topic": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
    "sendTo": "http://example.org/inbox/",
    "state": "",
    "rate": "P1"
  ```

* `receiveFrom`/`sendTo` formerly `source`/`target`

*  // notificationTarget?  or sendTo // target is not defined in Notification JSON-LD but alias to AS2's target.
* JSON-LD Context could map `notificationTarget` to `notify:target` or just use `notify:notificationTarget`.
* SubscriptionRequest (or Subscribe) subClassOf as:Activity
* topic -> as:object
* notificationsTarget -> does as:target actually work?
* state -> notify:state
* rate -> notify:rate
* eP: if we consider SubscriptionRequest as sub class of as:Activity, the target of the subscription request is not the target of the notification channel which is expected to be established.
* RG: We should think of the notifications "being sent" (as opposed to what the notification content) as the Activity.
* SC: Preferring to drop idea on using AS2


#### Subscription Response

* SC: If 201, then `id` should/must be `""` or `<URL>` of `Location` header.
* SC: If 200, then `id` can be omitted.

  ```json
  {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
    ],
    "id": "",
    "type": ["WebSocketNotifications2023", "NotificationChannel"],
    "topic": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
    "receiveFrom": "http://websocket.example/some-capability-url",
    "state": "",
    "rate": "P1M",
    "startTime": "2022",
    "endTime": "2022"
  }

  {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
    ],
    "id": "",
    "type": ["WebhookNotifications2023", "NotificationChannel"],
    "topic": "https://example.org/guinan/profile",
    "sendTo": "http://example.org/inbox/",
    "sender": "https://sender.example",
    "state": "",
    "rate": "P1M"
  }
  ```

* `receiveFrom`/`sendTo` formerly `source`/`target`


#### Notes from 2 hours ago
* RG: Why do you put it as an array? If we follow the `notificationService` predicate, it is clear that they all are services. Alternatively, have a separate property so that service is explicit.
* eP: There are cases for notifications channels which don't require subscribing, e.g., public resources can have public notification channels.
* SC: We have couple of options, redesign a lot of stuff. A major change.
* ...: We can clean up what we have to clean up right now. Around the subscription based approach.
* ...: The work can continue if we re-charter or if we get more people involved.
* eP: I think there is a middle ground, also will W3C Solid WG take on notifications spec? It might be a good opportunity to refine it further.
* SC: https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/blob/main/src/dokieli.js#L4936 using `as:Request` which was towards https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/253 .
* eP: Server MUST not change `sendTo`


### Update sequence diagrams
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/133

>ACTION: eP to update diagram if necessary as separate PR

* SC: I'm assuming that if those servers are requiring authentication or not is orthogonal. We don't have strict requirements. We encourage that serves are using existing mechanisms. I can imagine it working even without authentication. You mentioned that you could offer endpoint for public resources where you can subscribe without authentication.
* eP: Agree we don't need to get into details about authentication. Authentication is still a big part of the protocol.
* SC: In #134 we should lean on the `client` and `agent` instead of `sender`
* SC: Notification sender can authenticate as the `client`. We are not going be able to have sender authenticated as `agent`as well.



### Target terminology

>ACTION: SC: will update LDN subscription type to use `target` instead of `inbox` and `sender` instead of `webid`.

>ACTION: eP: will update draft PR for Webhook to use `sender` instead of `webid`.

* SC: See also https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/134 about access controls on `target` resource and whether both `agent` and `client` are needed in favour of `sender`.
* RG: Why do you have both `agent` and `client`?
* SC: Authorization uses it, currently ACP and there is demand from implementations to also add it to WAC.
* eP: Social entity is using some client. Need to be careful about different users where they can use the same client. When delivering notifications to the target, there are two different resource servers they use the same notification sender where identified by same client then maybe limit access to target that accepts notifications from the same client but some agents. We need to reconsider those cases.
* SC: Okay but notification sender is only able to authenticate for itself. How would an authorization rule requiring a particular client and a particular agent would work here when the notification server has no way to authenticate on behalf of the agent - at least at this time.
* eP: I have my storage / owner. I'm the agent. I can use notification sender service I can authenticate to it with Solid OIDC - it would refresh the token and give it offline scope. It can acts as a client on my behalf.
* SC: I'm open to changing `server` to client. I don't think how we are going to enable that software to authenticate as agent. Here we don't have expectation that is driven or piloted by agent. It is some process that is waiting for a trigger and sending notification. I don't see social entity involved in this loop. If the the target may need to be authorized for the client, I don't see an issue with that. If there is an issue if inbox is only specifying client. 
* eP: No implementation that I know of using notification sender authentication against target using Solid OIDC for example. Implementation in CSS is using custom authentication just for WebHooks. We discussed but won't rely on that.
* RG: Can you write a use case for this?
* eP: Will follow-up.
* eP: lets say the inbox is the target (for LDN notifications).. and lets say it is not secret so someone can be known. So ACME and Shady Inc can both use that. Then notifications from ACME is set but then Shady is sending too if they use same notification sender.
* SC: I see that but I guess it needs to be secret but only a specific client / notification server.
* RG: Isn't the notification sender separate for both ACME and Shady.
* SC: /inbox/ and notification-server-acme is `sender`, so notification-server-shady can't send notification.
* eP: Let's leave it in the issue for now. `sender` is okay but single IRI.. it could be both or either one. `{ sender: { client: 'pushy.example', agent: 'acme.example'}}`
* SC: Why not get rid of sender and use client and agent directly.
* eP: this could work, it depends which vocabs do we use.
* SC: it is important that we separate it if both `client` and `agent` are required. It also sets some limitations on how some resources are expected to be accessed. For example, if you only expect software to authenticate. If you have two entities cooperating, that works. There are cases where software acts on itself. I don't think we had covered that.
* eP: having `sender` could allow making it extensible to fit authn authz mechanism
* SC: Leave issue open but not expect for the next release.
* eP: AFAIK nothing implements it yet, we can make change later without breaking implementations.
