URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71



### Define Notification Content
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/60

* SC: Not critical for the next release but the underlying intent would be useful for the spec.
* SC: At the very least, right now it highlights what may be overspecifying, constraining, exposing information.
* SC: We should consider a simpler / minimal model for conformance.
* SC: (I suggested a way that can be Notification Profiles)


### Notification Profiles
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/101

>Introduce the notion of Notification Profile as an extension of the core Notification Data Model.
>Specific Notification Profiles can then be independently published.
