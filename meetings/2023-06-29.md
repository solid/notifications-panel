## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Milestones
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/milestone/1


### DiscoveryClient and SubscriptionClient in Solid Notification Client
URL: https://github.com/o-development/solid-notification-client/pull/1/files


* eP: It doesn't implement features yet since they are optional. 
* SC: Someone also had a client implementation in the feedback issue with the same name: https://github.com/woutslabbinck/Solid-Notification
* eP: I'll take another look at it and will see if we can collaborate
* SC: It seems to also implement DiscoveryClient and SubcriptionClient.
* eP: Implementation in current PR only uses `text/turtle` since we don't require specific framing it doesn't seem to be possibly to just treat JSON-LD as plain JSON. If RDF has to parsed Turtle seems just fine.


### Per Resource Events Protocol
URL: https://cxres.github.io/per-resource-events/protocol/

* RG: Intended to see how simple a protocol we can design for notifications that is completely functional.
* eP: Great/interesting. I was asking about RDF serialisations before anyone can implement.
* RG: Any format that you want to send / protocol is generic how you want to send. If you want RDF, write a mini-spec, in the pattern of Appendix A, for it is where you specify not only format but semantics on when to send the message. Even in SNP, we're not clear now how to equate updates in Activity Streams to HTTP methods like `POST`. That you have to specify in PREP for each format. If you're interested, we can do that on the side or separate session.
* eP: Understand it is receive-from scenario, so not like Webhooks/LDN.
* RG: Just uses HTTP streaming. This is a minimal protocol, not intended to replace SNP.
* SC: What do you want to get from this protocol?
* RG: I started working on it after our meeting 2 months ago. I wanted to see all the design questions I had answered. It may have taken a lot of time through the Solid Notifications Protocol. These questions may be answered through Per Resource Events Protocol.
* RG: I see this as a complementary thing because there are UCs... layering / scaling connections. Where you want to give people the options like the NP.
* SC: Can you elaborate on the UCs you've taken into account or left behind as out of scope?
* RG: I plan to publish a bit more on this but haven't formally done this. UC was HTTP streaming, quick connection, and CRUD.
* RG: Need to write a small spec to be Solid-specific. When you have to send a message for example.
* SC: Do you want to propose as a work item which you want to work on and possibly others. Do you plan to implement it? Do you want to keep it as parallel work in. I want to understand how much attention we should dedicate to it along Solid Notifications Protocol.
* RG: I have two big considerations. If this becomes somewhat successful, what would be the best practice to take this forward? Now that I did it, I think that this spec addresses backward-compatibility with HTTP/1. It can be further optimised by defining frames for HTTP/2. So possibly two or three protocols.
* SC: As mentioned, see if IETF/HTTPWG would work too. Don't overly lock it to Solid...
* RG: If you want to use it with Solid, the media types and data model would have to be defined specifically for Solid.
* eP: I've read yesterday but not all details. It didn't take long to see where it goes. Impressed with its neatness. Diving in to all the nuances will require an afternoon with coffee/tea... Encourage everyone to check it out.
* eP: Not sure which Group but it could be fitting in WHATWG too.


### Make AuthN/AuthZ of each channel explicit
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/155

* eP: I see it important because currently implementations are manually tested, e.g., CSS, so I can use it. CSS currently implements Webhooks/WebSockets. What CSS does with Webhooks, it currently suggests Solid-OIDC because of Solid Protocol. NotificationSender and ResourceServer are currently together. CSS is also a Solid OIDC provider. If they're enabled, NS can get token from OIDC provider. That's intentionally left out of scope in Solid Notifications Protocol. I want to have Solid OIDC provider on separate origin - not the same deployment - then .. So, internally way of getting tokens won't work. So with Webhooks to get capability URLs, ??? Solid OIDC is not well fit for server-side. NotificationSender acts as a Server-side client to send notifications. So needs to authenticate. Need a more fitting authn scheme for NS. Having this auth scheme on the channel helps improve things.
* SC: I'm keen on having it work with keys, it is LDN / Webhook case where key exchange happens, maybe messages can be signed or encrypted. Re https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/148 . The flow needs to work out.

ACTION: eP to PR to start resolving authn/z for each channel type.


### Add notify:filter feature
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/176

>ACTION: eP to review 176.

>ACTION: eP to create issue in notifications repo for mapping storage operations and Activities.


### SHACL shapes for data models
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/168


### Proposed optimization when using StreamingHTTP channel
https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/164



### Define unsubscribing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/145

* SC: Hoped we could start this topic with whiteboarding. Not enough time left.

>ACTION: SC to summarize the key behaviours for some of these options.

* SC: Todo still.

>ACTION: eP to create a issue to discuss advising subscription services of authorization changes on topics.
