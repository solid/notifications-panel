## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.
* eP: Scheduled to use Jackson's Library for webhooks in open-source Authorization Agent service implementation. Will also contribute to it.


### Notifications Protocol and WebSocket Subscription Type PRs
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/391 and https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/392
* SC: One review from the Editor's Team. Another review to follow "soon".
* SC: Will follow up the current review - seems to be minor and non-blocker for this publication. We can wait for other reviews before making any changes.
* SC: Will look into resolving / merging 2022-05-04. I'll ping the Editor's Team about it in any case.
* SC: I was hoping that we somehow resolve https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 and get that factored into the initial publication - brought that up in the last Editor's Team meeting but we didn't get too far into that. Needs a bit more work. Might not get that done in this week.
* SC: We may need to change the version. Will resolve as part of 2022-05-04 merging (IMO).


### Guidance to Subscription Type Publishers 1
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/59

* SC: Minor follow-up. Not urgent. Time to integrate this while review from the Editors team is taking place. Can we wrap this up this week so that we can include it as part of Notifications Protocol that's currently under review (<https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/391>)?
* SC: Made a brief comment to move this forward; otherwise we can merge the suggestions. The text does not need to be different between README and spec.
* RG: I have proposed new language
* SC: I think there are still some pending change requests
* SC: I can merge it and I plan to edit it further

ACTION: Sarven is going to resolve and merge changes, pending AC review.

### URL of Notifications Protocol Subscription Types
* SC: Follow-up on https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-07.md#url-of-notifications-protocol-subscription-types and https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-14.md#url-of-notifications-protocol-subscription-types
>ACTION: AC to review RG's PR to adjust the text as described above (to move that process forward and to describe the purpose of this README) -- link to these minutes
>ACTION: AC to create new document that will go to /TR/ (immediately after publishing the WS type), possibly immediately after the current spec PRs are merged
>ACTION: update the solid notifications protocol to point to the new document
>ACTION: AC to create an issue in the GH repository to track this

>* SC: Again, we have time re Editors reviews in parallel.
>* AC: I have not completed the items assigned to me yet but will this week.
>* SC: We should set as a goal that the publication of the ~FPWD to add description of the subscription types and where they can be found
>* SC: Something like `/TR/notification-subscription-types`.
>* AC: I assume this would be part of an independent PR to `solid/specification`
>* SC: Yes, that makes sense
>* SC: In the W3C process, editors are able/expected to make editorial changes where appropriate

* SC: Can we resolve these actions before 2022-05-04?
* SC: I can take on some of these ACTIONs if not completed by 2022-05-03.


### Define WebPushSubscription2022 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/64

* SC: Please review.
* SC: Let's have proposer in the meeting when we accept/merge provided no objections...
* eP: any outstanding issue can be tracked separately, this is an initial ED.
* SC: Sure, as long as it is no major change, e.g., term/property use...


### Protocol doesn't mention Subscription Response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/57
* eP: Subscription response has RPC model. We provide type, topic, etc., and server processes and responds. Different subscription types have different behaviour. Properties sometimes go on request and sometimes on response. We want clarity on which properties we would like on request and on response.
* SC: This is in response to the POST request, right? The response payload.
* SC: There are two parts. One is about information relevant to all subscription types (date, subscription type, etc.) and the other is subscription-specific stuff. The former we can look into. The latter is covered by each subscription type.
* eP: Every sub type uses different property on request and response. 
* SC: Two concerns: What payload should we include? What should be specific to each sub type?
* eP: what payload should be included is secondary. Clarity wanted on request and response.
* SC: Whatever is relevant to the request.
* RG: So there are some common properties on requests and responses, which should be defined in the core; some other ones are sub-type specific.
* SC: Let pavlik clarify.
* eP We need to define subscription request and subscription response first. Then define properties on each per subscription type.

ACTION: SC to make a PR.

* SC: We are not defining a vocab or properties just yet, but will there be a non-empty payload returned for every request?
* eP: Even if some subscription types don't return a payload, we still need to define the possibility of it.
* RG: Doesn't every subscription type have a response body?
* eP: subscription response might be optional. That can be decided later.
* SC: Let me look at the spec and come back.
