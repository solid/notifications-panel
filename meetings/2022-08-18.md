### Solid Notifications Protocol: Review notes
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/76

* SC: Talked with Tim about it (some specifics) but I didn't process the notes/review yet.
* SC: Can we all commit to addressing this review towards the next release of the Notifications Protocol (and WebSocket Subscription Type)?


### Discovery of Notification Subscription Metadata
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58

* SC: We need to resolve the issue on discovering channel information in order to make the next release of the Notifications Protocol.


### Add Solid Notification JSON-LD context
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/62

* SC: We need to follow up on this after resolving some issues in solid/notifications (linked in the review). It should be published this alongside the next release of the Notifications Protocol.


### Next release of Notifications Protocol
* SC: Solid Protocol 0.9.1 will be released with https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 resolved and will require (`MUST`) Notifications Protocol (NP). So, we should resolve https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 (along with some other low hanging fruit and other dependencies), and publish NP-next prior to Solid Protocol 0.9.1.



### Subscription resource as a container
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/36

>* CB: Request for comment :)

* SC: I didn't get to this. Was AFK. Will follow up.
