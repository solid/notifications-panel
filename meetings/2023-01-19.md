## Topics

* SC: Keeping the topics focused on work we need to iron out for the next release.

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback. Links to servers/applications and demos welcome.
* SC: Updated dokieli code to use Solid Notifications Protocol Version 0.2.0 and WebSocketChannel2023. Will do LDNChannel2023 next.


### Call for Implementations
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/141

* SC: Please re-share and help keep the data up to date.


### Several questions after implementing
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/114

* SC: I commented. Commenter satisfied. Will follow up with editorial updates.


### Create WebPushChannel2023
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/140

* eP: We defined `sendTo`, so makes sense to re-use that instead of a different predicate.
* eP: Another with `vapidPublicKey`: if that's the WebID of the SubscriptionServer - not sure where that was advertised. It'd be good to have that in the subscription-resource. Especially if NotificationSender is same as `sender`. However that's bootstrapped, the information about the `vapidPublicKey` can be included in a subscription-resource.
* CB: Re reusing `sendTo`, I will update the spec using that. With `vapidPublicKey`, originally had subscription-resource describing the subscription service. It was meant for that resource. So, that should match your recommendation.
* SC: Can you release WebPushChannel2023?
* CB: Prefer to update the 2022 version.
* SC: We try to transition to the concept of channel and channel type. I would suggest crating WebPushChannel2023.

ACTION: CB to PR WebPushChannel2023 notification channel type.


### Add ldn-channel-2023 ED
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/147

* SC: Gave an overview.
* eP: How much of that will stay in the channel type or should move to the protocol itself? Quite a few of those things, not specific to LDN type, e.g., unsubscribe, and how much should the channel type introduce? Or also with subscription resource acting like an inbox on top of the protocol, which may not be necessary for channel type to work. DELETE would be on the protocol level. Creating and deleting to un/subscribe. The `receiver` if needed, it can also move to protocol. re Signing features, channel type can offer that, perhaps also on the protocol level.
* SC: `activityType` feature, `receiver` (as proposed) could move to the main spec if useful generally and by other notification channel types. Exchanging public keys and signing - makes sense that these are part of the core Notifications Protocol. 201/Inboxes could be LDN specific or move up.
* eP: 201 could also be in Notifications Protocol.
* eP: Have to go.
* SC: Notion of public key can be in NP, and channel types that use it may want to pick their algorithm.
* CB: re encryption could be part of notifications protocol, only if it is not normative to use encryption, then there'd be some notification channels don't want to use for whatever reason. On the other hand, those who use encryption, may rely on different algorithms, then it is up to those channels to describe the encryption type, defining a subclass. So if there are some channels that utilise encryption from the start, we could introduce the notion.
* SC: We can take up https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/148 in the next meetings.
* CB: I'd rather just describe the possibility than to provide the means / define terms, but not say - not sure if I would recommend to use it or not.
* CB: Then we are on the same page.
* CB: Agree on `activityType` moving to NP.
* CB: With WebPush client, inbox changes, something is added or delete, and then I have to filter out the notification / however want to handle it. Nonetheless, it'd be easier to directly define what you are interested / types of notification.
* RG: Feature or not? Seems like a feature.
* SC: Not entirely sure but could be either. If present, it'd be specific, if missing, it'd be all activities (as is currently). Could also be just a feature.
* CB: Seems like for a simple implementation, they'd pipe all activities, for others, they'd be filtering based on the activity type. Same thing if you filter, start/endAt. Just a filter. From that perspective it is feature.

* SC: Continue the following topics in the next meeting.

### TR/notification-subscription-types
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types

* SC: Will add text to indicate it is an old version and refer to https://solidproject.org/TR/#notification-channel-type-registry .


### Include outdated warning in all subscription-types reports
* SC: TODO for editors/authors of:
  * WebSocketSubscription2021
  * StreamingHTTPSubscription2021
  * EventSourceSubscription2021
  * LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021
  * WebHookSubscription2021
  * WebPushSubscription2022
* SC: I can follow-up with updates to the README to draw attention to channel-types (indicate subscription-types is earlier work etc.)


### Ensure EDs of notification-channel type
* SC: Let's please make sure the ED publications of the notification-channel-type reflect notifications-protocol-20221231 for normative and non-normative information (e.g., update examples, authorization info).
* SC: There should be no conflation with the earlier subscription-types approach. Implementers will be referring to these EDs and TRs soon!

### Rename Subscription Resource to Subscription Service?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/63

* SC: There is some support to use "subscription service" or "subscription service resource".
* SC: This change doesn't affect conformance, if we agree on change, I suggest that we quickly roll it into Version 0.2.0, TR/notifications-protocol-20221231.
